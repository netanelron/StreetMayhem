This project is an academical project that I was tasked to do under ORT Braude College's excelling students program.
The project consists of a 2D fully interactive single-player javaFX game,where the user gets to play a man fighting his way through the street against various enemies, and a research document about javaFX's support of multithreading (written in Hebrew).
